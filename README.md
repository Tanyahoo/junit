Agile Software Development JUnit Testing - 2023 

Introduction: 

This repository contains the solution for an assignment of the Agile Software Development module offered at Atlantic Technological University, Galway. The assignment aims to develop a JUnit automated test suite for testing the provided Java application, InsuranceProgram.java. This is a fictitious scenario representing an insurance company that assesses the price of the premium dependent on potential customers' age. 

Details: 


The task involves refactoring the provided code to enable testing using JUnit5. This is achieved by completely refactoring the code in classes namely InsuranceProgramRefactored.java and writing tests for this code in InsuranceProgramRefactoredTest.java and helper class RunnerTest.java. 

Includes a comprehensive set of tests utilizing various JUnit annotations such as @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @Test, @ParameterizedTest, @Timeout, @AfterAll, and @AfterEach. 

Additionally, the test code handles two distinct kinds of exceptions encountered during testing. 

 

To Run: 

Clone this repository to your local machine. 

Execute the JUnit tests to verify the ‘correctness’ of the refactored code. 

Make any necessary changes or improvements. Draw your own conclusions! 

I/O utility not required to be tested. 

Note: This repository serves as a demonstration of my solution for a fictional scenario and is intended for educational purposes only.
